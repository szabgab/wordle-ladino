Add a button to share
If I forget to share when I am done, I'd still like to be able to click on some button and then share the results.

Allow the user the change the length of the word
5-letter words are cool, but have you tried 6-letter words?

Make it easy to add other languages
It would be nice if other languages could use the same code base without creating their own project.

This is too difficult. Allow the user to get a hint
e.g. by revealing one letter

Disable the letters that are no longer available
After trying a letter and getting it marked gray, the user should not be able to type it in any more.
(Maybe make this optional using a checkbox?)
> The optimal play can easily require letters that aren't available anymore. For example, if you open with "raise", and the "i" is green, and the "e" is yellow, then a near-optimal play is "fends", which narrows the possible solutions from fifteen down to at most two.
This will probably make the game more difficult
